# About me

I am a PhD student at the University of Liège, Belgium, under the supervision of Pr Damien Ernst. My research focuses on developing the modeling language and exploiting structure that exists in structured mixed integer linear programming problems (that typically arise in supply chain management or energy systems). My contact informations can be found [here](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/fr/repertoire?uid=u235534).

# Coding project
- The Graph-Based Optimization Modeling Language (GBOML) is a modeling language for mathematical programming enabling the easy implementation of a broad class of structured mixed-integer linear programs typically found in applications ranging from energy system planning to supply chain management. More precisely, the language is particularly well-suited for representing problems involving the optimization of discrete-time dynamical systems over a finite time horizon and possessing a block structure that can be encoded by a hierarchical hypergraph. The language combines elements of both algebraic and object-oriented modeling languages in order to facilitate problem encoding and model re-use, speed up model generation, expose problem structure to specialised solvers and simplify post-processing. The GBOML parser, which is implemented in Python, turns GBOML input files into hierarchical graph data structures representing optimization models. The associated tool provides both a command-line interface and a Python API to construct models, and directly interfaces with a variety of open source and commercial solvers, including structure-exploiting ones.
